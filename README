FourEx is a 4X Strategy Game in the spirit of Master of Orion, It is designed to be extensible, Cross-Platform, and Simple. It is an attempt to bring the fun of MOO to the modern platform, not to create a new gaming experience. It is currently in an early alpha state (more like a bunch of tests that amount to a mess).
